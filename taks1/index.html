                    <h2 class="about__title">Story About Us</h2>

                    <div class="about__text">
                        <p> We are a self-taught team that works on our project every day. We want to make something more than just a game, we have big ambitions and every day we are getting closer to our dream and Patreon helps us a lot in this. At the moment we are 10 people in the team, which are divided into departments. Right now we are not a commercial product, and none of us receive any salary from the project. But we are doing our best to become more serious as a team and as a company in the future.
                            Now we are working on a Tactical - dynamic FPS Shooter in a variable setting of parallel worlds.</p>

                    <h3 class="about__suptitle">What we do</h3>

                    <div class="about__text">
                        <p>1.- We want to implement a serial plot in free time. It's like a favorite series whose plot changes while watching, and is not written in advance.</p>
                        <p>2.- We want to make a truly exciting shooter by crossing the two directions of Dynamism and Tactics. What would the player need to show their best qualities as shooting and combat strategy.</p>
                        <p>3.- We are working on the unique abilities of robots, their classes, weapons and grenade types. All this greatly affects the diversity of the gameplay.</p>
                        <p>4.- Each game map will be very different from the rest, both stylistically and conceptually. Each map will have its own original story that will be interesting to dive into, as it is directly related to the lore of the game "IMPULSE"
                            There are also many other cool ideas that we plan to implement in the future.</p>
